# arculus-devops-challenge
This repository contains my solution for the DevOps Engineer (Linux) technical challenge.

Work plan:

Part 1: Application + CI (GitHub Actions)

Part 2: Docker image build/push

Part 3: Kubernetes deployment + Ingress/TLS

Part 4: Monitoring

How to run and test will be documented as the implementation is added.
